      Hello there. My name is Marcos Brito and, I've been writing code for a
      while. I see programming as some kind of art. Simple code, elegant
      architectures and nice looking text files are a few things that could make
      me cry and being able to create that is something I'm really proud of.
      Here is some stuff I'm into with no particular ordering:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>*nix ricing:</strong>
        Been doing since I started using GNU/Linux. Took me many months to understand
        that trying to make my enviroment more productive wasn't very productive.
        Nowadays, it looks nice, feels good and I can do actual work. I barely touch
        it.

        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Compilers and programming languages:</strong>
        By far my favorite thing. I've been through quite a few books and code bases.
        I always try to make room for it in my studies and will give my best to find
        a way to fit an interpreter in any project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Operating systems:</strong>
        There are two perspectives on this one: Bare metal programming and lower
        level OS interactions. Even though I haven't written any OS my self yet,
        I had great time reading <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org">OS dev</a>,
        the
        <a href="https://www.kernel.org">Kernel archives</a> and a few micro-kernels
        out there.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Distributed architectures:</strong>
        The years made me not appreciate web development much, but I still have great
        time planning architectures, microservices and solving system design problems.
        I enjoy writing backend code and with the amazing tools out there I can even
        tolerate writing UIs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I don't want to make this an extensive list of everything I ever enjoyed
      nor make it very personal, so I'll stop right here. If you are looking for
      something more technical and professional, please check the
      <a href="/nnago/resume">resume page</a>. Thank you for your time.
